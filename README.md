## Introduction

The OpenV2X open source project will realize a V2X edge cloud control platform that supports
roadside, vehicle and comprehensive data fusion perception analysis, North-South interface of
transaction data, North-South interface of operation and maintenance management; 52 basic functions
such as equipment, GIS and comprehensive visualization management will be realized; Openv2x will
complet 17 typical application scenarios such as intersection collision warning, no pass warning,
vulnerable traffic participant collision warning, perception data sharing, collaborative lane change
in the first phase. And will complete 12 typical applications in the second phase such as perception
data sharing, cooperative lane change, and cooperative merge. The OpenV2X open source project builds
a digital foundation for intelligent transportation by providing information services, ensuring
traffic safety, improving traffic efficiency, and realizing autonomous driving and other typical
application scenarios, enabling autonomous driving and autonomous transportation.
