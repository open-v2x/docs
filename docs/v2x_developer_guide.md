## Tips

If you want to focus on the development of a specific module, we recommend that you use the
[all-in-one installation script](https://github.com/open-v2x/docs/blob/albany/src/v2x-quick-install.md)
to deploy , the delete the container of the corresponding module by command
`docker stop <module> & docker rm <module>`, and then use your own developed programm in the system.
