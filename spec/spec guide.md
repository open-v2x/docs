## Introduction

The OpenV2X open source project will realize a OpenV2X edge cloud control platform that supports
roadside, vehicle and comprehensive data fusion perception analysis, North-South interface of
transaction data, North-South interface of operation and maintenance management; 52 basic functions
such as equipment, GIS and comprehensive visualization management will be realized; OpenV2X will
complete 17 typical application scenarios such as intersection collision warning, no pass
warning,vulnerable traffic participant collision warning, perception data sharing, collaborative
lane change in the first phase. And will complete 12 typical applications in the second phase such
as perception data sharing, cooperative lane change, and cooperative merge. The OpenV2X open source
project builds a digital foundation for intelligent transportation by providing information
services, ensuring traffic safety, improving traffic efficiency, and realizing autonomous driving
and other typical application scenarios, enabling autonomous driving and autonomous transportation.
